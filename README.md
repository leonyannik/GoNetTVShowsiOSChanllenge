# Tv Shows Challenge

This Challenge was submitted to GoNet

## Arquitecture

Mostly, the app is writen in the MVC protocol, if the app would became more complicated, and the need to reuse data across the views should pop, then I would try to use MVVM instead.
I decided to use a storyboard, due to the simpleness of the app

### Frameworks

To show that i can use third party libraries, a library that displays banners when clicking favorite is used.
intalled with cocoapods

### Persistance

CoreData was used, to save the favorite shows, and i decided to use NSURLSession instead of a thirdparty library to show that i undestand networking.
